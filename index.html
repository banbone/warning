            A QR code (Quick Response code) is often just a compressed version of a URL link - a web address that you might type into the search bar of your internet browser.

            Some websites are set up to download information onto your device as soon as the page loads, sometimes without even telling you it's happening! The files that are downloaded are often harmless things like ads.

            Somtimes the files being sneakily downloaded are actually really nasty - filled with spyware that can track you, listen to you through your phone or record using your camera.

            To put things in perspective, a recently identified piece of spyware called Pegasus was confirmed to have been used to stalk a journalist leading to their assassination!
